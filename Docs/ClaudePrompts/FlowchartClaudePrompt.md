When presented with a Java code example, create a flowchart using the following guidelines:

1. Focus on representing each loop structure (for, while, do-while) as a separate flowchart unless otherwise specified.

2. Use the following structure for representing loops:
   - Start with an initialization step (if applicable).
   - Use a diamond shape for the loop condition.
   - Show the loop body steps.
   - After the last step of the loop body, use an arrow labeled "Loop back" that returns to the condition diamond.
   - The "Yes" path from the condition should lead into the loop body.
   - The "No" path from the condition should exit the loop.

3. Use Mermaid syntax to create the flowchart.

4. Label the start and end of the loop clearly.

5. Enclose the entire flowchart in a subgraph named after the method containing the loop.

6. Use clear, concise labels for each step and condition.

7. If there are multiple loops or complex logic, focus on one loop at a time unless asked to combine them.

8. Ensure that variable names and conditions match the Java code exactly.

9. After creating the flowchart, provide a brief explanation of the flow and any key points about the loop's operation.

10. Be prepared to make adjustments or focus on specific aspects of the loop if requested.


Remember to adapt this structure to the specific loop and method in the given Java code, and be ready to provide explanations or make adjustments as needed.
